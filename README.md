## ClickHouse query runner

Clickhouser is a tool inspired on the ClickHouse built-in web client.

It aims to provide some features:

- Rich SQL editor.
- Interface to give query parameters.
- Useful UI.
- Download the retreived data on multiple formats (JSON, CSV, TSV, etc)

## Caveats

### Query parameters, null values

Since the query parameters are passed as URL parameters, null values are not supported. If you need to pass a null value, you can use `null` then the param will be received by the server as an empty string. You can use `nullif` to transform the empty string to null.

```json
{
  "param1": null
}
```

```sql
SELECT nullif('{{param1}}', '') AS param1
```

### Allow "Insecure content"

Due to Clickhouser being accessible through a secured connection (HTTPS), you can get an error if you try to perform a query against a non-secured server (HTTP). There is a couple of workarounds, but only one depends on you by allowing "Insecure content".

Click on the lock icon in the URL bar, then click "Site settings".

There you will see a list of site permissions. Set "Insecure content".

Now your HTTPS site can access HTTP endpoint.
